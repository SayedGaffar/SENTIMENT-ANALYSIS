## In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on Turkey Earthquake tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public emotions and opinions. The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the sentiment distribution, classifying tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Using TextBlob for polarity scoring and Seaborn for visualizations, I identified trending hashtags and key discussion topics. The insights derived from this analysis can help authorities, NGOs, and media outlets understand public sentiment, respond effectively to concerns, and improve crisis communication strategies.
