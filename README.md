## In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on Turkey Earthquake tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public emotions and opinions. The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the sentiment distribution, classifying tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Using TextBlob for polarity scoring and Seaborn for visualizations, I identified trending hashtags and key discussion topics. The insights derived from this analysis can help authorities, NGOs, and media outlets understand public sentiment, respond effectively to concerns, and improve crisis communication strategies.

## Conclusion

Sentiment Distribution:
A significant proportion of tweets expressed negative sentiment, reflecting distress, concern, and frustration.

There were also positive sentiment tweets, often offering prayers, support, and appreciation for rescue efforts.

Neutral sentiment tweets typically conveyed factual updates and information.

Recommendations:
Authorities and NGOs can leverage sentiment analysis to track public concerns and identify areas requiring immediate support.

Media Monitoring can help in understanding the effectiveness of relief measures and crisis communication.
